On the to-do-list: I'm currently working on developing a new way to calculate bandwidth on Praat without using the "Get Bandwidth" function. Once it's finished, I expect this bandwidth measurement to be more reliable. I also plan on integrating a measurement of (F4-F3)-(F5-F4), where a lower absolute value indicates more equally spaced higher formants and a higher probability that the sound is nasal (Sundberg et al. 2007). I want to include some kind of F3,F4,F5 metric for determining nasalization because all of the other values are dependent on F1.
